			<h2>My First Quarter at Drexel</h2>
			<h3>December 7th, 2016</h3>
			<p>After transferring from Penn State after my freshman year, I thought that almost anything would be an improvement over the experience I had there. I was lulled into a school that was incongruent with my personality because I could not see past the cheap tuition and well-regarded Computer Science program. To friends I had a year or so below me who were applying to college, my advice was, "Pick the cheapest school you can get into, and major in something lucrative. You're bound to find people you like at a large public university." And to a degree, I still think this is true. You are statistically likely to find people like yourself within a group of 40,000 in the same age demographic. Debt is also definitely something that should be carefully considered going into college.</p>
			<p>But what I didn't realize was that, if you don't get lucky in the first go-around with clubs (I certainly didn't), it can be hard to find those select few who you can relate to. Along with that, you shouldn't necessarily expect to form strong friendships in the first year. However, in the absence of these strong friendships, if you are constantly left interacting with the culture you don't fit in to find these friends, it is an incredibly demeaning amount of frustration. Feeling isolated and eventually realizing I wasn't a fit for my major was a one-two punch that I couldn't handle, and I eventually decided to transfer to Drexel.</p>
			<p>That doesn't mean Drexel has been a breath of fresh air or anything of the sort; I enjoy it more here, but it also has its share of challenges that I had to go through in my first quarter here that helped me grow as an individual in way's Penn State didn't. The big shock to me, as it was with many people, is time management. Trying to handle moving to a new environment, building social connections all over again, the quarter system, joining a fraternity and other clubs, adjusting to a new workflow (more projects over assignments/tests), and much more has exhausted every second of my day. Especially later in the term, the stress got to the point where I wasn't able to enjoy anything I was doing, even going to the fraternity I am pledging for leisure felt like a chore to keep up appearances.</p>
			<p>I've still gained a lot, though. I've met a ton of interesting people who I feel far more similarities to then I did at the average person I knew at Penn State. I feel like my major is a much better fit for me than Computer Science was, and I can be more successful specializing in it in the future. I met a girl who is now my girlfriend. I think there will be more challenges in the future, but I feel much better about my sense of direction here than I ever did at Penn State.</p>
