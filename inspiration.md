# IDM 221 - Favorite Websites

## keep.google.com

Google Keep is an online note-taking and reminder app. Part of Keep's appeal over other services like Evernote is that Keep is ridiculously simple, but packs a lot of functionality to make it more than a stock text editor like the native notes app for iPhone or Android. The UI is beautiful and it sets a standard for me of how an interactive website should be designed. I also appreciate how it gives the user freedom to create their own pseudo-features and practices instead of restricting what they can or can't do in the notes they create.

## spotify.com

Spotify is a music streaming platform that allows you to play a gigantic catalog of music from over the web. I can safely say that I don't think I would have the appreciation I currently have for music if it wasn't for Spotify. The ease of searching for almost any album you can imagine opened me up to many different artists and genres that I probably never would have considered before, had we stuck with the $1 per song price model. I also feel that it has one of the most intuitive UIs on the market, and much of its widespread success can be attributed to that. On the lowest level, it puts all of the necessary information in very accessible places, which is the hallmark of any great UI.

If Spotify gives me access to the all of the world's music, then AOTY directs me where to go. It might have some grey areas where the design and functionality can be improved, but its usefulness in aggregating _relevant_ critic and user reviews and its community is unparalleled (although it seems to be dying off a bit). Many sites also aggregate reviews, but usually ignore the more niche review outlets and therefore leave a huge segment of the music community unaccounted for. I think some of the search functions could be improved, as I feel I have to go through a few too many pages before finding the information I need, but it gets the job done.
